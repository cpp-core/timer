# Synopsis
`core::timer::Timer` is a header-only, micro-timer for modern
`C++`. The timer is designed to faciliate minimal-overhedad, ad-hoc
timing of `C++` code including micro-timing down to a single machine
instruction. The timer is not designed for benchmarking
([benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) or
[nanobench](https://github.com/martinus/nanobench) are excellent tools
for this purpose) nor for detailed performance analysis.

# Basics
The timer has two basic modes:
- Inovking `run` on isolated code for in vivo measurements.
- Using `start` and `stop` timer calls for in vitro measurements.

## In Vivo Example
The `run` method is designed to repeatedly execute isolated code in
order to measure the average cost per operation. Modern compilers,
taking advantge of the `C++` standard's "as if" rule, will often
eliminate code that produces no visible side-effects making this type
of measurement difficult.

The timer library provides the `core::timer::doNotOptimizeAway`
function which forces the compiler to materialize the given expression
either in memory or in a register. The compiler is still allowed to
fully optimize the expression given that single constraint.

The following example demonstrates using the `run` method coupled with
the `doNotOptimizeAway` function to measure the cost of performing an
integer addition (i.e. `output += 1`). Without the `doNotOptimizeAway`
call, a typical outcome is for the compiler to eliminate all of the
computation since there are no visible side-effects.

```c++
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include "core/timer/timer.h"

using namespace core;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {

    unsigned int output{};
    auto ns = timer::Timer().run(1'000'000, [&]() {
	    output += 1;
	    timer::doNotOptimizeAway(output);
    }).elapsed_per_iteration();
    
    std::cout << std::setprecision(2) << ns << " nanoseconds per operation" << std::endl;
    // 0.31 nanoseconds per operation
	
    return 0;
}
```

## In Vitro Example
The `start` and `stop` methods can be used to instrument code as it
exists without isolating it to be executed by `run`. On a modern
platform, each invocation of `start` and `stop` costs tens of clock
cycles, thus, they are designed to be applied to more significant code
segments.

The following example demonstrates using the `start` and `stop`
methods to measure the cost of an exclusive or performed in a
loop. Referencing the `output` variable at the end serves the same
function as the `doNotOptimizeAway` function in the previous example;
it forces the compiler to actually do the computation.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "core/timer/timer.h"

using namespace core;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    
    timer::Timer timer;
    timer.start();
    unsigned int output{};
    for (auto i = 0; i < 10'000; ++i)
		output ^= i;
    timer.stop();

    auto ns = timer.elapsed().count();
    std::cout << ns << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;
    std::cout << output << std::endl;
    // 3150 nanoseconds
	
    return 0;
}
```
